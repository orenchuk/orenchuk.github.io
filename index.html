            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm a software developer with over 4 years of experience developing iOS apps. I've always been passionate about technology and software development, and iOS development has been a perfect fit for me.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, mostly startups, which has given me a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities that come with building software in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.</p>
            <p>Working with startups has allowed me to be part of small, agile teams where I can have a direct impact on the product and its success. I've learned how to balance technical requirements with business needs and how to prioritize features and functionality to meet tight timelines and budgets.</p>
            <p>I enjoy the energy and creativity that comes with working for startups, and I'm always excited to collaborate with entrepreneurs and founders to help bring their ideas to life.</p>

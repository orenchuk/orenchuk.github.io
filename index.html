            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I love creating things, and code is my way of doing it. I started coding when I was at school, and since then, I knew I'd develop apps for Apple platforms. Right now, I'm writing a fully SwiftUI + Combine app — Alter Ego, as a CTO & co-founder of the project. Practice yoga and meditation.</p>
